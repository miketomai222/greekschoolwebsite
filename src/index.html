                  Our Saturday school is designed for children to develop their Greek language skills naturally
                  while immersing themselves in culture, history, and traditions. Led by dedicated teachers who
                  are passionate about both education and heritage, our classes help children grow their confidence
                  in speaking, reading, and writing Greek while staying connected to their roots.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We offer classes from Reception to A Levels, ensuring that every child can learn at their own
                  pace and progress in a structured way.
