# Claude Instructions for Greek Community School Website

## Project Overview

Static website for the Greek Community School of Newcastle - a community school teaching Greek language and culture to children and adults in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.

See [README.md](README.md) for:
- Key information (contact details, location)
- Tech stack
- Project structure
- Getting started / commands

## Design System

See [src/styles/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](src/styles/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md) for:
- Theme colors and fonts (CSS variables)
- Utility CSS classes (buttons, layout, cards)
- Web components

## Conventions

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Keep components simple - this is a content site, not an app
- Placeholder links use `#` until Google Form URLs are provided
- English content first; Greek translations will be added later via i18n
- Use theme CSS variables (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-accent`) for consistent styling

## Notes

- No images/logo yet - use placeholders
- Registration forms link to external Google Forms (URLs TBD)
- Bilingual support (EN/GR) planned - structure should accommodate language switching
