## Design System

See @src/styles/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md for:

## Web Components

See @src/components/WEB-COMPONENTS.md for:
- Component list
- Implementation details

## Conventions

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Keep components simple - this is a content site, not an app
- Placeholder links use `#` 
- Use theme CSS variables (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-accent`) for consistent styling

## Notes

- No images/logo yet - use placeholders
- Registration forms link to external Google Forms (URLs TBD)
- Bilingual support (EN/GR) planned - structure should accommodate language switching
